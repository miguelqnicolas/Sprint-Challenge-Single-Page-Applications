## Question

Explain the benefit(s) of using `client-side routing`?

Client side routing allows you to make a super fast website. It allows you to make 'pages' without reloading the page and only update parts of the DOM that need to be. Usually, pages are seperate and the page will reload and there will be what they call a 'flash'. This goes against the whole idea of React. Client-side routing allows you to circumvent that.
